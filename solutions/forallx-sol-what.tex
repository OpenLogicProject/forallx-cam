\chapter{Arguments}
Highlight the phrase which expresses the conclusion of each of these arguments:
\begin{earg}
	\item It is sunny. So \myanswer{I should take my sunglasses}.
	\item \myanswer{It must have been sunny}. I did wear my sunglasses, after all.
	\item No one but you has had their hands in the cookie-jar. And the scene of the crime is littered with cookie-crumbs. \myanswer{You're the culprit}!
	\item Miss Scarlett and Professor Plum were in the study at the time of the murder. And Reverend Green had the candlestick in the ballroom, and we know that there is no blood on his hands. Hence \myanswer{Colonel Mustard did it in the kitchen with the lead-piping}. Recall, after all, that the gun had not been fired.
\end{earg}

\chapter{Valid arguments}
\problempart
Which of the following arguments is valid? Which is invalid?

\begin{earg}
\item Socrates is a man.
\item All men are carrots.
\item[So:] Therefore, Socrates is a carrot. \hfill \myanswer{Valid}
\end{earg}

\begin{earg}
\item Abe Lincoln was either born in Illinois or he was once president.
\item Abe Lincoln was never president.
\item[So:] Abe Lincoln was born in Illinois. \hfill \myanswer{Valid}
\end{earg}

\begin{earg}
\item If I pull the trigger, Abe Lincoln will die.
\item I do not pull the trigger.
\item[So:] Abe Lincoln will not die. \hfill \myanswer{Invalid \\ Abe Lincoln might die for some other reason: someone else might pull the trigger; he might die of old age.}
\end{earg}

\begin{earg}
\item Abe Lincoln was either from France or from Luxemborg.
\item Abe Lincoln was not from Luxemborg.
\item[So:] Abe Lincoln was from France. \hfill \myanswer{Valid}
\end{earg}

\begin{earg}
\item If the world were to end today, then I would not need to get up tomorrow morning.
\item I will need to get up tomorrow morning.
\item[So:] The world will not end today. \hfill \myanswer{Valid}
\end{earg}

\begin{earg}
\item Joe is now 19 years old.
\item Joe is now 87 years old.
\item[So:] Bob is now 20 years old. \hfill \myanswer{Valid}
\\\myanswer{An argument is valid if and only if it is impossible for all the premises to be true and the conclusion false. It is impossible for all the premises to be true; so it is certainly impossible that the premises are all true and the conclusion is false.}
\end{earg}

\problempart
\label{pr.EnglishCombinations}
Could there be:
	\begin{earg}
		\item A valid argument that has one false premise and one true premise? \hfill \myanswer{Yes. \\Example: the first argument, above.}
		\item A valid argument that has only false premises? \hfill \myanswer{Yes.\\Example: Socrates is a frog, all frogs are excellent pianists, therefore Socrates is an excellent pianist.}
		\item A valid argument with only false premises and a false conclusion? \hfill \myanswer{Yes. \\The same example will suffice.}
		\item A sound argument with a false conclusion? \hfill\myanswer{No.\\ By definition, a sound argument has true premises. And a valid argument is one where it is impossible for the premises to be true and the conclusion false. So the conclusion of a sound argument is certainly true.}
		\item An invalid argument that can be made valid by the addition of a new premise? \hfill\myanswer{Yes.\\ Plenty of examples, but let me offer a more general observation. We can \emph{always} make an invalid argument valid, by adding a contradiction into the premises. For an argument is valid if and only if it is impossible for all the premises to be true and the conclusion false. If the premises are contradictory, then it is impossible for them all to be true (and the conclusion false).}
		\item A valid argument that can be made invalid by the addition of a new premise? \hfill \myanswer{No.\\ An argument is valid if and only if it is impossible for all the premises to be true and the conclusion false. Adding another premise will only make it harder for the premises all to be true together.}
	\end{earg}
In each case: if so, give an example; if not, explain why not.

\chapter{Other logical notions}
\setcounter{ProbPart}{0}
\problempart
\label{pr.EnglishTautology}
For each of the following: Is it necessarily true, necessarily false, or contingent?
\begin{earg}
\item Caesar crossed the Rubicon.
\hfill \myanswer{Contingent}
\item Someone once crossed the Rubicon.
\hfill \myanswer{Contingent}
\item No one has ever crossed the Rubicon.
\hfill \myanswer{Contingent}
\item If Caesar crossed the Rubicon, then someone has.
\hfill \myanswer{Necessarily true}
\item Even though Caesar crossed the Rubicon, no one has ever crossed the Rubicon.
\hfill \myanswer{Necessarily false}
\item If anyone has ever crossed the Rubicon, it was Caesar.
\hfill \myanswer{Contingent}
\end{earg}

\problempart
\label{pr.MartianGiraffes}
Look back at the sentences G1--G4 in this section (about giraffes, gorillas and martians in the wild animal park), and consider each of the following:
\begin{earg}
\item G2, G3, and G4
\hfill \myanswer{Jointly consistent}
\item G1, G3, and G4
\hfill \myanswer{Jointly inconsistent}
\item G1, G2, and G4
\hfill \myanswer{Jointly consistent}
\item G1, G2, and G3
\hfill \myanswer{Jointly consistent}
\end{earg}
Which are jointly consistent? Which are jointly inconsistent?

\

\problempart
\label{pr.EnglishCombinations}
Could there be:
\begin{earg}
\item A valid argument, the conclusion of which is necessarily false?
\item[] \myanswer{Yes: `$1+1=3$. So $1+2=4$.'}
\item An invalid argument, the conclusion of which is necessarily true?
\item[] \myanswer{No. If the conclusion is necessarily true, then there is no way to make it false, and hence no way to make it false whilst making all the premises true.} 
\item Jointly consistent sentences, one of which is necessarily false?
\item[] \myanswer{No. If a sentence is necessarily false, there is no way to make it true, let alone it along with all the other sentences.}
\item Jointly inconsistent sentences, one of which is necessarily true?
\item[] \myanswer{Yes. `$1+1=4$' and `$1+1=2$'.}
\end{earg}
In each case: if so, give an example; if not, explain why not.

\problempart
We symbolised an \emph{exclusive or} using `$\eor$', `$\eand$', and `$\enot$'. How could you symbolise an \emph{exclusive or} using only two connectives? Is there any way to symbolise an \emph{exclusive or} using only one connective?
\\\myanswer{For two connectives, we could offer any of the following: 
\begin{center}
$\enot(\meta{A} \eiff \meta{B})$\\
$(\enot\meta{A} \eiff \meta{B})$\\
$(\enot (\enot \meta{A} \eand \enot \meta{B}) \eand \enot (\meta{A} \eand \meta{B}))$
\end{center}
But if we wanted to symbolise it using only one connective, we would have to introduce a new primitive connective.
